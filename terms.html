You agree that Promo Codes: (i) must be used for the intended audience and purpose, and in a lawful manner; (ii) may not be duplicated, sold or transferred in any manner, or made available to the general public (whether posted to a public form or otherwise), unless expressly permitted by Instabike; (iii) may be disabled by Instabike at any time for any reason without liability to Instabike; (iv) may only be used pursuant to the specific terms that Instabike establishes for such Promo Code; (v) are not valid for cash; and (vi) may expire prior to your use.

</p>
	<br><h4 class="text-center"><b>Customer T&C</b></h4>
	<p><b></b>User Provided Content.</b></p>
	<p>Instabike may, in Instabike's sole discretion, permit you from time to time to submit, upload, publish or otherwise make available to Instabike through the Services textual, audio, and/or visual content and information, including commentary and feedback related to the Services, initiation of support requests, and submission of entries for competitions and promotions ("User Content"). Any User Content provided by you remains your property. However, by providing User Content to Instabike, you grant Instabike a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferrable, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use, copy, modify, create derivative works of, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, and otherwise exploit in any manner such User Content in all formats and distribution channels now known or hereafter devised (including in connection with the Services and Instabike's business and on third-party sites and services), without further notice to or consent from you, and without the requirement of payment to you or any other person or entity.</p>
	<p>You represent and warrant that: (i) you either are the sole and exclusive owner of all User Content or you have all rights, licenses, consents and releases necessary to grant Instabike the license to the User Content as set forth above; and (ii) neither the User Content nor your submission, uploading, publishing or otherwise making available of such User Content nor Instabike's use of the User Content as permitted herein will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party's intellectual property or proprietary rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.</p>
	<p>You agree to not provide User Content that is defamatory, libelous, hateful, violent, obscene, pornographic, unlawful, or otherwise offensive, as determined by Instabike in its sole discretion, whether or not such material may be protected by law. Instabike may, but shall not be obligated to, review, monitor, or remove User Content, at Instabike's sole discretion and at any time and for any reason, without notice to you.</p>
	
	<br><h4 class="text-center"><b></b>4. Payment</b></h4>
	<p>You understand that use of the Services may result in charges to you for the services or goods you receive from a Third Party Provider ("Charges"). After you have received services or goods obtained through your use of the Service, Instabike will facilitate your payment of the applicable Charges on behalf of the Third Party Provider, as such Third Party Provider's limited payment collection agent. Payment of the Charges in such manner shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you to the Third Party Provider. Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Instabike. You retain the right to request lower Charges from a Third Party Provider for services or goods received by you from such Third Party Provider at the time you receive such services or goods. Instabike will respond accordingly to any request from a Third Party Provider to modify the Charges for a particular service or good.</p>
	<p>All Charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated by Instabike using the preferred payment method designated in your Account, after which Instabike will send you a receipt by email. If your primary Account payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that Instabike may, as the Third Party Provider's limited payment collection agent, use a secondary payment method in your Account, if available.</p>
	<p
	>As between you and Instabike, Instabike reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise Charges for any or all services or goods obtained through the use of the Services at any time in Instabike's sole discretion. Instabike will use reasonable efforts to inform you of Charges that may apply, provided that you will be responsible for Charges incurred under your Account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof. Instabike may from time to time provide certain users with promotional offers and discounts that may result in different amounts charged for the same or similar services or goods obtained through the use of the Services, and you agree that such promotional offers and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or the Charges applied to you. You may elect to cancel your request for services or goods from a Third Party Provider at any time prior to such Third Party Provider's arrival, in which case you may be charged a cancellation fee.
</p>
	<p>This payment structure is intended to fully compensate the Third Party Provider for the services or goods provided. Except with respect to taxicab transportation services requested through the Application, Instabike does not designate any portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity to the Third Party Provider. Any representation by Instabike (on Instabike's website, in the Application, or in Instabike's marketing materials) to the effect that tipping is "voluntary," "not required," and/or "included" in the payments you make for services or goods provided is not intended to suggest that Instabike provides any additional amounts, beyond those described above, to the Third Party Provider. You understand and agree that, while you are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity to any Third Party Provider who provides you with services or goods obtained through the Service, you are under no obligation to do so. Gratuities are voluntary. After you have received services or goods obtained through the Service, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback about your Third Party Provider.</p>
